Most of my work has been on proprietary codebases. Here are a few small projects that are [publicly available](https://github.com/mdeutsch).

### [simple_jsonapi](https://github.com/patientslikeme/simple_jsonapi)

**simple_jsonapi** is an easy-to-use and easy-to-understand library for building [JSON:API](https://jsonapi.org) documents in Ruby. I developed it after finding that the available JSON serialization libraries were either generic and difficult to use for JSON:API or overly integrated with the Rails framework.

### [diffusion-limited aggregate simulation](/projects/dla)

A rather simplistic implementation of a [diffusion-limited aggregate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion-limited_aggregation) that I wrote as an exercise in learning TypeScript.

### [composite-logging](https://github.com/patientslikeme/composite-logging)

**composite-logging** is a Ruby gem that supports logging to multiple locations, customizable formatting, tagging, thread-safe silencing, and a simple configuration DSL. For a bit more history, see the [blog post](http://tech.patientslikeme.com/2014/08/05/yet-another-logging-gem.html).
